# Automatic download on raspberry
This repository aims to automatically download files from direct download links, like uptobox.com, 1fichiers.com...
The scripts get an URL from a gmail address and launch the download.
It will then rename the file and move it to the right folder.

## Start a script on reboot
- modify launcher.sh
- sudo crontab -e
